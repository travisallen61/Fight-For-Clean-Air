        <p align="center"> The immediate effects of air pollution are hard to ignore. Watery eyes, coughing and difficulty breathing are acute and common reactions. <br>

            An estimated 92 percent of the world’s population live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution and,<br> even at seemingly imperceptible levels, air pollution can increase one’s risk 
            of cardiovascular and premature death. <br>
        <br>
        Air pollution is almost as deadly as tobacco. In 2016, it was linked to the deaths of 6.1 million people, <br> according the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 

        And it might harm you even before you take your first breath.
        <br>
        <br>
        Exposure to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy has been linked to miscarriages as well as premature birth,<br> autism spectrum disorder and asthma in children. <br>

        Air pollution may damage children’s brain development, and pneumonia, <br> which kills almost 1 million children under the age of 5 every year, is associated with air pollution.<br> 
        Children who breathe in higher levels of pollutants
        also face a greater risk of short-term respiratory infections and lung damage.

         <h3 align="center"> Millions of Americans suffer from asthma. However, most people don't know how brutal it is to live with the disease. <br>
            Environmental triggers, like ozone pollution, can exacerbate asthma.

            The Clean Air Act gives us all the legal right to breathe clean, healthy air. We demand clean air now. </p>
